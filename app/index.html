					<p>I worked with <a href="http://www.digitalpulp.com/" target="_blank">Digital Pulp</a> as a lead front-end developer and accessibility consultant/developer for the redesign of Juilliard.edu. The new site would align with a major overhaul of the brand's identity and web presence. Working in Drupal 8, I built modular Twig files, and organinzed design patterns with Sass and Javascript. I implemented accessibility features to meet WCAG 2.0, and wrote documentation for accessibility guidelines that can be followed for most web development projects. The site was designed against 4 main breakpoints, with touch devices in mind as well.</p>

The site had multiple reviews for WAI-ARIA compliance, so we thoroughly tested each template with screen readers.  Many JQuery-based modules were created, such as animated, swipeable slideshows with adjusted layout based on screen size.  Tempaltes were developed for and tested on many tablet and mobile devices.</p>

We brought more responsiveness to interactive elements, and cleaned up much of the front-end code base.  On the homepage, we re-integrated social media API's, and removed many unnecessary HTTP requests that were causing sluggish load times. I developed a <a href="http://joshdreier.com/clients/samsung/hero" target="_blank">prototype</a> for a horizontal scrolling interface for the homepage's hero area. We made many improvements in presentation and interaction, as well as under the hood, resulting in success.</p>

Over sixty pages were developed and tested for all modern browsers before delivering to the client's backend team. Part of the challenge was building a clean and standardized codebase on top of a messy legacy website, but it was met handily. The site was developed for SEO, as well as 508 Compliance.

The design was intricate and it was necessary to stay pixel-perfect before handing off to our back-end development partners. Instead of using JQuery plug-ins, we hand-coded all JS functions to make for a more seamless integration. All HTML was verified to comply with current web standards and standard accessibility guidelines. Kiboo is now in the process of finding a bank partner in order to launch the working site.

					<p>Partnering with New York-based agency, <a href="http://www.flintny.com/" target="_blank">Flint</a>, I developed all presentation layer coding for PrimeScout, a social networking site intending to bond athletes and athletic scouts. The athlete's main profile page or "dashboard" had many coding challenges as it packed all of the athletes personal information onto one page.  I used many hand-coded JQuery elements, such as accordion menus, tab systems, tool zips, and zebra striping, to gracefully present the wealth of data on the dashboard. The main navigation was also a complex piece to develop, with three rows of expanding menus that needed to layer over one another. All HTML was verified to comply with current web standards and standard accessibility guidelines. PrimeScout is now in live in beta.</p>

					<p>Partnering with New York-based agency, <a href="http://www.flintny.com/" target="_blank">Flint</a>, I handled all aspects of website development for Capstone Energy Services.  The marketing initiative intended to humanize the energy company's relationship with customers by presenting information in a simple and engaging manner.  I developed a PHP template system to easily create new pages within the site architecture.  I used JQuery to create tab systems and animated sliding menus. And I developed a WordPress page that looks and feels like the rest of the site, where the client can add news articles.  The most current article is fed into a "Latest News" content box on the homepage.</p>

					<p>The Michelangelo, a luxury suite hotel in midtown Manhattan, was in need of an up-to-date website that would properly reflect their posh accommodations.  I worked with the director of sales to propose a redesign and functional specifications that would completely rebrand their online presence.  We used new photography and fun interactive elements such as slideshows, Google maps, sliding menus, and dynamic scrollbars to make for an engaging user experience. The site looks and functions great on mobile devices, and the booking form remains in view on every page. The contains more than 50 pages and is translated in 5 languages.</p>

					</ul>
					<p>Staybridge Suites &#149; Times Square was in the process of being constructed when I first met with the hotel's operations and marketing team.  They needed a new website that would set them apart from other hotels in the area, and apart from their traditional brand image.  I gave them a design that would afford users a feeling of being comfort and coziness while staying in the heart of the bustling city. The site build concentrated on simplicity and emphasized search engine optimization. We ran a Facebook video promotion called "The Big Broadway Break" where I installed an application that would sign up users and display their video content; I then set up a blog in WordPress for the winner of the contest.</p>

					<p>Rare Bar &amp; Grill, a burger chain in New York, asked for a new website that would be more organized, user-friendly, and most importantly &ndash; display consistently on all platforms and devices.

I designed a clean template and added new photography to give the restaurant a fresh digital presence. Interactive elements include menu viewer, photo slideshows, Google Maps, Open Table and SinglePlatform API's.</p>

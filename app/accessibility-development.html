			<h2>Page titles<sup>(2.4.2)</sup></h2>
			<ul>
					<li>All pages must have a <code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code>.</li>
					<li>The title must describe topic or purpose of the webpage.</li>
					<li>Multiple webpages on the site should not have the same title when they have different content or purpose. When a page loads, a visually impaired screenreader user first hears the page title. If they have already encountered that title, they may assume that they have already seen this page, and navigate away from it. </li>
					<li>It is best practice to front load the most important and page specific part of the title – that is, start with most specific description the content or purpose of the current webpage, followed by a site section name and finally the site name. That way the user doesn't need to hear text that is repeated as the start of several web pages, and immediately knows that they have reached the page they expect.</li>
					<li>Usually the main <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> content heading on a page matches or reflects the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> text. </li><li>Avoid using pipes in title (<code>|</code>), as screen reader will read out "vertical line."</li>
			</ul>

<h2>Semantic markup<sup><sub>(4.1.1) </sub></sup></h2><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0)">All markup elements should have complete start and end tags</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0)">Elements should be nested according to their specifications</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0)">Elements should not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs should be unique.</span></li><li>Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.</li></ul><h2>Headings and page structure<sup><sub> </sub></sup><sup><sub>(1.3.1, 2.4.1, 2.4.6, 4.1.2) </sub></sup></h2><ul><li>There must be a mechanism for users to bypass repeated blocks of content on a webpage – usually a mechanism to bypass the topmost <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> region to reach the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> content is sufficient.</li><li>There should be only one <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading on a page, heading up the main content.</li><li>Page regions should be marked up into semantic regions.</li><li>The heading structure of a web page must be hierarchical. In practice this means looking at different regions on a webpage, and creating heading structures within each one.The main content region is headed up by a descriptive <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading, then main content sections and sub sections marked up using <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>s, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>s, etc. Ideally the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> should be the first content in the region, but a small amount of content before it, such as a breadcrumb trail is permissible.</li><li><em>Multipart headings</em> <sup><sub>(3.1.2)</sub></sup><sup><sub> </sub></sup>(items with seemingly 2 different headings) should not be structured into 2 separate headings.  Example of correct way: <code>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="top"&gt;Latest News&lt;/span&gt;Stock Market Up&lt;/h3&gt;</code></li><li>Paragraphs in the content must be marked up semantically using <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements.<code><br></code></li></ul><h2>Content order<sup><sub> </sub></sup><sup><sub>(1.3.1, 1.3.2) </sub></sup></h2><p>Content order is important. For instance, in the HTML markup, headings should precede their associated content, even if CSS is used to reorder or arrange content visually on the webpage. Ask yourself: if you were to switch off CSS, would the main content form a logically structured document? If not, then the order of the content in the HTML mark-up must be rearranged to make it logical.</p><h2>Lists<sup><sub> </sub></sup><sup><sub>(1.3.1, 1.3.2) </sub></sup></h2><p>Modules with items that present themselves in a horizontal or vertical array should be marked up as a semantic unordered list (<code>&lt;ul</code>&gt;). If there is a certain order to the list, such as breadcrumbs, an ordered list (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>)can be used. </p><h2>Visible focus outlines, keyboard tabindex<sub>  <sup>(1.4.3, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.4.3, 2.4.7, 3.2.1) </sup></sub></h2><p>When tabbing through the site, all items that are focusable (<code>&lt;a&gt;, &lt;button&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, &lt;textarea&gt;, &lt;iframe&gt;</code>, etc.) are part of the tab index, and need to have a bold indicator <code>outline</code> meeting the 3:1 color contrast ratio requirement.</p><ul><li>Use "<code>tabindex: '-1'</code>" to remove focusability from elements</li><li>Use "<code>tabindex: '0'</code>" to add focusability to elements</li><li>A CSS mixin for the <code>outline</code> is useful to apply options to certain elements that need outlines with different colors or positioning. <code>box-shadow</code> can be used as the outline for more control.</li><li>Mouse users do not need to see the <code>focus</code> <code>outline</code>.  JS can be used to listen for mouse vs. keyboard clicks, and only show <code>outline</code> for keyboarders.</li><li>Confirm keyboard focus is never locked or trapped at one particular page element. The user can navigate to and from all navigable page elements using only a keyboard.</li></ul><h2>Hiding content off-screen<sup><sub> </sub></sup><sup><sub>(2.4.6, 2.4.7) </sub></sup></h2><p>Occasionally, it is useful if content were present in HTML mark-up, but hidden from view. This is so visually impaired screenreader users have access to information that might not be visually apparent otherwise, but the content does not visually clutter the webpage. Use a global CSS class or mixin to hide the content offscreen.</p><p>Focusable items, such as <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, that are hidden off-screen, should become visible on <code>:focus</code>.  Here is example CSS, that hides a button offscreen unless it is focused:</p>
<pre>
button {
    &amp;:not(:focus) {
        @include visually-hidden;
    }
}</pre>
<h2>Hiding content from screen readers and assistive technologies<sup><sub> </sub></sup><sup><sub>(2.1.1) </sub></sup></h2><ul><li><p>The best way to hide content from assistive technologies is to use the CSS property, "<code>display: none;</code>"</p></li><li>If "<code>display: none;</code>" cannot be used for some reason, the next best option is to use "<code>aria-hidden='true'</code>" to hide elements from assistive technologies.  This can be useful for carousel items that are offscreen, for instance.</li><li>If "<code>aria-hidden='true'</code>" is used instead of "<code>display: none,</code>" make sure that all focusable elements inside the container have been removed from the tabindex.  This can be done using by setting "<code>tabindex='-1'</code>"</li></ul><h2>Button controls for same page interaction/navigation<sup><sub> </sub></sup><sup><sub>(2.1.1, 2.4.3) </sub></sup></h2><p>Ensure that all focusable controls have the correct and expected roles. In general,</p><ul><li>Controls which are links to other webpages must have a link role. They should be marked up using the native hyperlink element (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>). If this is not possible, then they should be given an ARIA role=”link” attribute. </li><li>Controls which have a same page action or submit a form, must be marked up as a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>. Generally, controls that have a same page action, should have a button role. This is best achieved using the native &lt;button&gt; element. If this is not possible, then they should be given an ARIA role=”button” attribute. This includes: <ul><li>Accordion controls</li><li>Display navigation controls (such as hamburger menu controls)</li><li>Open and close modal controls</li><li>Video controls (play, pause, stop, etc)</li><li>Next and previous buttons for image viewers.</li><li>Carousel controls, including next and previous buttons, and individual slide detector buttons</li><li>Slide show controls</li><li>Main menu hamburger button</li></ul></li></ul><h4><em>Exceptions</em></h4><p>For menu links, in a navigation menu, which when activated display a dropdown menu or other navigation panel. These technically should have button roles, but are so well known, that hyperlinks will do if the hyperlinks have <code>aria-expanded</code> attributes which are managed.</p><p>If a hyperlink or button is marked up using a generic element, such as a div or a span, then these,</p><ul><li>Must be given an appropriate ARIA role</li><li>Must be added to the tab order using <code>tabindex=”0”</code>, so as to be focusable for keyboard-only users</li><li>Must have, in addition to click events, keyboard events defined, so users can activate them using the enter key, and/or the space bar key.</li></ul><h2>"Learn more" or "Read More" links<sub>  <sup>(2.4.4) </sup></sub></h2><p>Links such as “Read more” or “Learn more” on their own don’t provide a complete description of their destination. The text preceding them provides a content which makes their destination clear, and this context must be programmatically associated with the link.</p><ul><li>The destination of the link must be clearly and unambiguously described, and must be programmatically determinable</li><li>As they are links to new pages, they must have a link role (eg, using an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element); they must not have button roles, even if they visually appear button-like.</li></ul><p>From the visual context, it is apparent what the destination of a “More” type of link is. However, this visual context, which completes an accurate and complete description of the destination of the link, must also be programmatically determinable. Without this, for visually impaired screen readers the destination of the link would not be clear from the text alone. This will be exasperated when there are multiple “more” type links on a page, as the links would have identical label text, but different destinations. The most reliable solution is to design the component so that the visible descriptive text is in the same structural element as the link, so can be accessed by a screenreader without the user having to move away from the link itself.   This is what is meant by programmatically determinable.</p><p>The structural containing elements suitable to wrap around the link AND descriptive content to make the purpose of the link clear include:</p><ul><li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, where the link is part of the paragraph that contains the description</li><li><code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, where the link is part of a list item that provides the context</li></ul><p>The above solution is considered most reliable because it doesn't depend on content editors having to change text that they cannot see other than in code view.</p><p>There are many other possible solutions; one of the first two solutions (title attribute, or hidden text) would probably be easiest</p><ul><li>Using a title attribute</li><li>Using hidden text within the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code></li><li>Using an <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute</li><li>Using an <code>aria-label</code> attribute</li></ul><h2>Images<sup><sub> </sub></sup><sup><sub>(1.1.1, 1.3.1) </sub></sup></h2><h4>Text alternatives for images</h4><p><strong>Informational images: </strong>Images that convey information must have accessible text alternatives,</p><ul><li>If the image does not need a visible caption, then it can be served in an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, with an descriptive alt attribute.</li><li><p class="auto-cursor-target">If the image has a visible caption, it can be served up by a <code>&lt;figure&gt;/&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element set. The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> should be given an empty alt attribute, and the caption marked up as a &lt;figcaption&gt;</p>
<pre>
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img alt=”” . . . /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Caption text&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
</pre>
<p>A less desirable option would be to alert the screenreader to the presence of an image, and from that they can infer the text immediately following it is its caption. Ideally it should be grouped within an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element, which would alert the user that this is supplementary information, and allow them to move to the end of the &lt;aside&gt;, and on with the article text.</p>
<pre>
&lt;aside&gt;
    &lt;img alt=”Image:” . . . /&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;Caption text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
</pre>
</li></ul><h4>Decorative images</h4><p>A decorative image must be hidden from assistive technologies. This can be done in the following ways,</p><ul><li>Preferably, serving up the image using a CSS <code>background-image;</code> which will be automatically hidden from screen readers.</li><li>If not, then serving up the image using a CSS pseudo element. But as this may be voiced by a screenreader, the element must be hidden from screen readers using the <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute,<br><code>&lt;span class=”icon” aria-hidden=”true”&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></li><li>Or serving up the image in an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, with an empty <code>alt</code> attribute</li></ul><h2>Graphic symbols (eg, greater than symbol)<sup><sub> </sub></sup><sup><sub>(1.1.1) </sub></sup></h2><p>The arrow graphic should be rendered in such a way to be hidden from screen readers and other assistive technologies. (If it is a character in the HTML mark-up, screen readers will announce the link as “Learn more greater than”). Hiding the symbol can be achieved by one of the following methods,</p><ul><li>Serve up the symbol using a CSS <code>background-image</code> rule.</li><li>Serve up the symbol using a CSS content rule, but hidden from assistive technologies using the <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute.</li><li>Using a greater than symbol in the HTML markup, but hiding it with an <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute<br><code>&lt;span aria-hidden=”true”&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></li></ul><h2>Asides with quoted text<sup><sub> </sub></sup><sup><sub>(1.3.1, 1.3.2) </sub></sup></h2><p>Similar to images in the article text, sometimes a quote box is pulled out of the article and inserted in the flow of the article’s content. If this text were undifferentiated from the rest of the content, screenreader users might be confused: text would be for some reason read out twice, and where it occurs in the flow of text may be illogical.</p><p>A solution is, again, to use an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element. Screenreader users encountering it will be alerted that this content is outside the flow of the article text, and choose whether to read it, or jump over it and continue with the article text.</p>
<pre>
&lt;aside&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
        text text
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Tabbed content<sub>  <sup>(2.1.1) </sup></sub></h2><ul><li>Roles and states must be defined for the tab list, individual tabs, and tab panels. States must be managed</li><li>Keyboard-only users must be able to interact with tabs in the expected way.</li></ul><p>Badly marked up tabs and tab panels can cause havoc for assistive technology users.  So if it can't be done properly, then find an alternative way to display this type of content.</p><p>To get it right, all states, roles and associations must be defined using ARIA attributes including,</p><ul><li>the role attribute: tabs should have <code>role="tab</code>", and the tab panels themselves <code>role="tabpanel"</code>.</li><li>The relationships between tabs and tab panels can be defined using aria-controls (on tabs) and <code>aria-labelledby</code> (on tab panels) attributes.</li><li>The state of each panel (displayed or hidden)  is defined by an <code>aria-selected</code> attribute on the tab, which must be managed (true or false).</li></ul><p> All keyboard-only users should be able to tab to the currently selected tab, and then navigate through them using the left and right arrow keys.</p><p>A good fully working example of an accessible tab panel system has been developed by Nicolas Hoffmann: <a href="http://a11y.nicolas-hoffmann.net/tabs/#robust_accessible">http://a11y.nicolas-hoffmann.net/tabs/#robust_accessible</a></p><h2>Modal windows<sub>  <sup>(2.1.1, 2.4.7, 3.2.1) </sup></sub></h2><p>There are many ways to technically implement modal dialogs, but in general the required mark-up and behavior to achieve an accessible implementation is as follows,</p><ul><li>The open modal control must have a button role</li><li>When the modal is opened, focus must be managed (moved to modal)</li><li>The modal must be able to be closed, and when it is, focus must be managed (moved back to triggering element)</li><li>When open, users interaction must be confined to the contents of the modal. This includes screenreader users.</li></ul><p> An example of an accessible implementation of a modal is <a href="https://github.com/gdkraus/accessible-modal-dialog">Greg's Incredible Accessible Modal Window</a>.</p><h4>The open modal control role</h4><p>The control has a same page action, and must have a button role. This is best achieved by using the native <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element.</p><h4>Managing focus when opening:</h4><p>When the modal is opened, focus should be moved to either the modal’s</p><ul><li>Close button</li><li>The first heading in the modal</li><li>the modal container itself</li><li>The first or only form field in the modal</li></ul><h4>Closing modal dialog:</h4><p>The modal dialog must be able to be closed. While it is good practice for the escape key to close the modal, it is not sufficient on its own. A close <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> must be present.The position of the keyboard focus before the modal popup was opened should be saved, so when the modal is closed, focus can be returned to that location.</p><h4>Constraining screen readers to content of dialog</h4><p>The modal dialog must constrain the screenreader user within the modal dialog content so that the user can’t accidentally interact with the page behind the dialog while it is open. This can be achieved by wrapping the entire page’s contents in a container with an aria-hidden attribute. Eg, <code>&lt;div aria-hidden=”true”&gt;</code>.</p><h4>Informing screenreaders that focus has moved</h4><p>When a modal is opened, and focus has been moved, screenreader users should be informed that focus has been moved and they have reached the content. A convenient way of achieving this is to make sure the modal has a main <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading, and that this is marked up as an ARIA live region. When live regions are revealed in the DOM, or their contents changed, those contents are announced by screenreaders. So for instance,</p>
<pre>
&lt;h1 aria-live="assertive"&gt;
    Modal Media Gallery
&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>
<p>If the heading does not need to be visually displayed, it can be hidden off-screen using CSS.</p><h2>Carousels<sub>  <sup>(2.1.1, 2.2.2) </sup></sub></h2><p>Digital Pulp recommends using the "Slick" Carousel plugin library, as it provides the most comprehensive accessibility features out of the box: <a href="http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/">http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/</a></p><p>For sighted keyboard-only users:</p><ul><li>All carousel controls must be in the tab order, and be reachable and operable using only the keyboard.</li><li>All the controls must have visible focus indicators, so users can see which controls have received focus. These must be accessible - see “Visible focus outlines" section above.</li><li>The controls and slides must have a logical sequence. For instance: Previous, Next, followed by individual slide pickers (these may be dots, or thumbnails).</li><li>Users must not be able to tab to any focusable controls in slides which are hidden from view. Ideally hidden slides should be removed from the DOM using <code>display:none</code>. If "<code>display: none;</code>" cannot be used for some reason, the next best option is to use "<code>aria-hidden='true'</code>" and <code>tabindex="-1"</code> within the slides to hide elements from assistive technologies.</li></ul><p>The above requirements can be easily tested by unplugging the mouse and attempting to operate the carousel using only the keyboard. Meeting these requirements will probably mean the carousel is accessible for sighted keyboard-only users. However, they also need to be made accessible for users relying on access technologies such as screen readers, which visually impaired users may be using.</p><ul><li>All controls must be marked up semantically with the correct button roles (next, previous and individual slide selectors).</li><li>All next and previous controls, and the individual slide selectors must have accessible text labels (that is, text alternatives for symbols) that describe their purpose. Without these labels a screenreader user tabbing to a control will just be told a button is present, but not its purpose. For example,<ul><li>“Next Faculty Member”, “Previous Faculty Member”;</li><li>the individual slide pickers may be generic, such as “Slide 2 of 5”, or a short descriptive text of the thumbnail. </li><li>In the slide selectors, the one currently selected  is visually indicated, for instance by a solid dot, rather than a circle. This state must be made programmatically determinable using aria-selected=”true”.</li><li>The individual slide controls are presented visually as a list of items. This presentation must also be programmatically determinable. Mark-up the controls using a semantic &lt;ul&gt; list element.</li><li>Visually the next and previous buttons are grouped as a two item list. This presentation must also be programmatically determinable. Mark-up the two items using a semantic &lt;ul&gt; list element.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Automatically playing slideshow</h4><p>As a general rule, carousels should not play automatically, as the movement may distract those with cognitive issues. If a carousel does play, then it should play for no more than 5 seconds, and have a "Pause" button.</p><h2>Videos<sub>  <sup>(1.2, 2.1.1, 3.2.1) </sup></sub></h2><h4>Video controls</h4><p>Videos form a problematic area of accessibility, with many “off the shelf” solutions failing accessibility quite badly. The following will help ensure the player you use is as accessible as possible.</p><ul><li>All video controls must be in the tab order, and be reachable and operable using only the keyboard.</li><li><p>All the controls must have visible focus indicators, so users can see which controls have received focus. See "Visible focus outlines" section.</p></li><li>All video controls must be marked up semantically with the correct roles: that is, buttons are marked with button roles (preferably <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>), sliders with slider roles, and so on.</li><li>All controls must have accessible text labels (these are usually text alternatives for symbols) that describe their purpose. Otherwise a screenreader user tabbing to a control will just be told a button is present, but not its purpose.</li><li>Where necessary the state of the control must be indicated – for instance, whether they are on or off, or what the current value of a slider is.</li></ul><h4>Automatically playing videos/Ambient videos</h4><p>As a general rule, videos should not play automatically, as the movement may distract those with cognitive issues, and the sound will interfere with screenreader audio. If a video does play, then it should play for no more than 5 seconds if silent or 3 seconds if it includes audio.</p><h4>Captions, audio descriptions and transcriptions</h4><p><em>Some definitions:</em></p><ul><li>Audio description: a sound track that describes any visual information and plays synched to speech and visuals.</li><li>Captions: subtitles appearing visually onscreen which reflects all that is said by actors, and describes important sounds and noises</li><li>Text transcription: full text alternative - transcription everything said, sound effects, visual information pertinent to understanding, and who has done the speaking. This text should either follow the video in the content; or a link to the transcription should be adjacent to the video.</li></ul><p><em>To pass WCAG 2 level A:</em></p><ul><li>Audio description OR text transcription is needed if there is visual information being conveyed in the video but not described in the audio.</li><li>Captions must be provided.</li><li>For silent video, there must be a short description of the video available, and if the video is informative, a text transcription provided.</li></ul><p><em>To pass WCAG 2 level AA:</em></p><ul><li>Must have audio description if visual information is not described in the standard audio track,</li><li>Does not need text description, but it is a nice to have.</li><li>Must have captions.</li></ul><h4>Loading or linking to a video player</h4><p>Assuming an image such as the above acts as a control to load a video player, whether in place or in a modal, or is a link to a video page, then this control must be marked up with an accessible text label.</p><ul><li>If it loads a video in place, or in a modal, the control must be a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>.</li><li>If it links to another webpage with a video that starts automatically and has a player embedded there, the control must have a button role.</li><li>The play button is an information image. It must have an appropriate descriptive accessible text alternative, such as “Video:”, or “Load video”. See “Images" section.</li><li>Text positioned over background images must be presented accessibly with passable color contrast ratio.</li><li>If the image is decorative, it must be hidden from assistive technologies.</li></ul><h4>Choosing an accessible video player</h4><p>Accessible video players are difficult to implement, or to find. Able player (<a href="https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/">https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/</a>) is one of the most accessible video players available. Alternately, the HTML5 YouTube video player is reasonably accessible, and has the advantage of being well known by users, meaning they are likely to know workarounds for any accessibility short falls.</p><h2>Forms<sub>  <sup>(3.3) </sup></sub></h2><p>The following accessibility requirements are true for any form, and must be met here:</p><ul><li>All individual form controls must have an accessible and programmatically associated label.</li><li>Label text must always be visible</li><li>Information must be provided to identify all required fields</li><li>Errors must be reported</li><li>Individual form controls with error messages must have those error messaged programmatically associated with them.</li><li>Color difference must not be the only visual clue to distinguish error messages from other content.</li><li>Captchas must be understandable and operable by keyboard only users, and by assistive technology users.</li><li>Labels and error messages must pass minimum color contrast requirements. This includes when visible labels are rendered as visible &lt;label&gt;s, or as placeholder text when the &lt;label&gt; is not visible.</li></ul><h4>Programmatically associated labels</h4><p>All individual form fields must have a programmatically associated label.  We highly recommend using the standard <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element (even if they are not always visible).</p>
<pre>
&lt;label for=”lastname&gt;Last name”&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id=”lastname” /&gt;
</pre>
<h4>Label visibility</h4><p>There must always be a visible label for each form control. </p><ul><li>Label text is visible when the text box is empty (visually supplied by the placeholder text),</li><li>If the placeholder disappears when the textbox receives focus, then the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> must be made visible</li><li>The <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> is visible when the text box contains text.</li></ul><p>In short, a visual label must always be visible.  This is because a screen magnification user might not see the label before they tab to the text box - if they have tabbed to a text box, and because the placeholder has disappeared there is no visible label, they will not know what input is expected of them.</p><h4>Required fields</h4><ul><li>A description must be given on how required fields are indicated. It would be good if it were a little more descriptive than just “* required”.</li><li>For each required form control, the asterisk must be programmatically associated with the control – just make sure the asterisk is contained within the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>, and not positioned outside it. <br><code>&lt;label for=”x”&gt;Last name *&lt;/label&gt;</code>.</li><li>If possible, add a <code>required</code> and/or ARIA <code>aria-required="required"</code> attributes to the form control. This will ensure assistive technologies do inform users the field is required.</li></ul><h4>Reporting errors</h4><p>When an user submits a form with errors, they must be informed that errors have occurred, and on which fields. Be as specific as possible – for instance, providing a list of all fields in error, where the fields are identified by naming their label values, and the error described. This can be best achieved by positioning a summary <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> list of error messages at the beginning of the form with an appropriate heading, such as “Errors were found”. Positioning this after the form heading is a place that users can easily find.</p>
<pre>
&lt;h2&gt;Admissions form&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;There were 4 errors found&lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please correct the following errors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;First name missing&lt;/li&gt;

<p>If the page is not refreshed on submission (that is, page content is updated dynamically), move the focus to the error heading. Otherwise when a screenreader user submits the form with errors, it will appear as if nothing has happened.</p><h4>Errors messages on individual fields</h4><ul><li>A field in error must have a programmatically associated error message, or error indicator.</li><li>A field in error must have a visible error indicator, that does not rely on color alone</li></ul><h4>Programmatically associated error message</h4><p>Make sure that the error text is programmatically associated with the form control in error. Otherwise, when a visually impaired screenreader moves focus to this control, only the label “Phone number” may be read out, and they will not know there is an error; or they will have difficulties in finding fields in error when navigating through the form. The error message can be programmatically associated by adding the text inside the programmatically associated <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element,</p>
<pre>
&lt;label for=”phone”&gt;
    &lt;span class=”error”&gt;Error: field missing&lt;/span&gt;
    Phone number *
&lt;/label&gt;
</pre>
<p>or by programmatically associating the text using the ARIA <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute. The screenreader will read out the label text, followed by the text referenced by the <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute,</p>
<pre>
&lt;span id=”phone_error” class=”error”&gt;
    Error: field missing
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;label for=”phone”&gt;
    Phone number *
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id=”phone” aria-describedby=”phone_error” ... /&gt;
</pre>
<h4>Does not rely on color alone</h4><p>In the example, a message “Error: field missing” is given. This is good because the word “Error” gives a clear indication this is an error message without relying on the red color alone. Without this, the text would not necessarily be recognized as an error message text.</p><p>Note, an alternative to using plain text would be to use an error icon with an appropriate accessible text alternative.</p><h4>Captchas</h4><p>Captchas are very problematic in terms of accessibility, often relying on sight or sound.  However, while the latest version Google's No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA does present challenges for some disabled people though see below), with some reservations, our recommendation is to implement the latest version of Google No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA.</p><h4>Alternatives</h4><p>There are a number of more accessible ways to protect against spam attacks, most of them discussed in the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Wiki page, "CAPTCHA Alternatives and thoughts” (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Captcha_Alternatives_and_thoughts">https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Captcha_Alternatives_and_thoughts</a> ).</p><p>We suggest that at least one of the alternatives could be used as the first step of a Multi-level approach.  For instance:</p><ol><li>A "honey pot" trap is positioned between the first and second fieldset elements and given a label that would discourage screenreader users from selecting it; and</li><li>If the checkbox is checked, a script function appends the reCAPTCHA to the end of the form.</li></ol><p>This could potentially protect keyboard only users and screenreader users alike from encountering the CAPTCHA. However any multi level Turing test needs careful consideration and rigorous testing to ensure that the security of the form isn't compromised.</p><h2>Infinite scrolling</h2><p>Infinite scrolling (or loading) of a page is not addressed in any WCAG success criteria as yet. However, it should be noted that keyboard only users who are not using any assistive technologies might well have to tab through endless amounts of links before they can reach content beyond the listing, such as the page footer, and may well give up in frustration. We strongly recommend using pagination instead, with a reasonable amount of results per page.</p><p>The situation isn’t as problematic for screenreader users, if the list is marked up as an unordered list. They can jump to the end of the list element, and bypass the results if they wish. But we stress, this functionality is not available to disabled people who are not using an assistive technology.</p><p>This article recommends pagination, or a button that would load more results: <a href="https://simplyaccessible.com/article/infinite-scrolling/">https://simplyaccessible.com/article/infinite-scrolling/</a></p><h2>Color contrast<sub>  <sup>(1.4.1, 1.4.3) </sup></sub></h2><p>The contrast between an outline color and the background color must meet the minimum 3:1 color contrast requirement.</p><p>If you are relying solely on changing the background color, of a button for instance, the color contrast between the focused and unfocussed background colors must be at least 3:1. The same applies if you are relying solely on a change of text color.</p><p>If you rely on the default browser focus styling, the background color on which it falls must also be the default background color of the browser (almost invariably white). Expecting a default focus indicator to be visible against a non-default background color will invariably make it difficult or impossible for sighted keyboard users to see which control has focus. </p>
